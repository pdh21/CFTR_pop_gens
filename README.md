Requires Python and Juypter notebook. If you don't have python, I suggest installing from [anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). 
Download Python 2.7 NOT Python 3

You will also need [simupop](http://simupop.sourceforge.net/). If you have installed python with anaconda, you should simply be able to install with the command: `conda install -c https://conda.binstar.org/simupop simuPOP`
